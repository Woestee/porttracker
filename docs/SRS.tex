\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document explains what our Stock Market Portfolio Tracker is supposed to do and what features we plan to include for this snapshot. The goal is to keep our team organized and have a clear idea of what we want the finished version to look like.

\subsection{Intended Audience}
Our intended audience includes

    They may check this document to confirm the scope of the project, the goals for this snapshot, and the direction of the system.
    \item \textbf{Technical Reviewers}  
    Reviewers may look at this SRS to make sure the system design is clear and that the requirements follow good engineering practices.
    \item \textbf{Future Developers joining the project}  
    They may use this document to quickly understand the overall idea of the app and what has already been planned or completed.
    \item \textbf{General Audience interested in the project}  
    This includes anyone who wants a basic explanation of what the Stock Market Portfolio Tracker is supposed to do without needing technical knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview}
The Stock Market Portfolio Tracker is a simple web app that lets users keep track of their stocks in one place. Many people have accounts with more than one brokerage, so this tool gives them a single dashboard to check prices, total value, and profit or loss. This document explains the requirements for what we plan to build.

\section{Product Scope}
The main goal is to build an easy to use platform where users can
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create an account
    \item Add the stocks they own
    \item Check real time prices
    \item Track gains and losses
    \item Set simple alerts
\end{itemize}

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{User Classes}
For this snapshot, we only have one user type.

\textbf{Standard User}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create an account and log in
    \item Add, edit, or delete stocks
    \item View real time price data
    \item Set simple alerts
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operating Environment}
The system will run in the following environment
\begin{itemize}
    \item Web browser such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox
    \item Frontend built with React
    \item Backend built with Node and Express
    \item PostgreSQL database
    \item External stock price API such as Yahoo Finance or AlphaVantage
    \item Docker Compose for deployment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies and Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User has a working internet connection
    \item Stock price API must be online
    \item Ticker symbols must be valid
    \item App depends on correct API keys
    \item Users should use an updated browser
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Stories}
\begin{itemize}
    \item As a user, I want to add a stock so I can track it
    \item As a user, I want to see live price updates so I know my profit or loss
    \item As a user, I want to edit or delete my stocks when needed
    \item As a user, I want alerts for large price changes
    \item As a user, I want a simple dashboard that is easy to read
\end{itemize}
