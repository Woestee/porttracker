\section{Revision Summary for Version 2.0}

The system requirements were updated after the team moved from the original React and Node design to a simpler Flask and SQLite setup. Snapshot 2 represents the first working version of PortTracker, where users can add stocks and see them displayed on a dashboard. Prices for now are placeholders since real time API integration is planned for Snapshot 3.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document describes the requirements for Snapshot 2 of PortTracker. It focuses on what the system must do at this stage, the features that should be available to users, and how the app is expected to behave.

\subsection{Intended Audience}
This document is written for
\begin{itemize}
    \item Students who will continue building the next version
    \item Instructors reviewing the progress for Snapshot 2
    \item Contributors who want an overview of the system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview}
Snapshot 2 provides
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ability to add new stocks
    \item A Dashboard page that displays stored holdings
    \item A local SQLite database for saving data
    \item Basic navigation and flash messages for feedback
\end{itemize}

Real time prices and deletion are not part of this version.

\section{Product Scope}
The main goal of Snapshot 2 is to create a simple and functioning portfolio tracker. In this version users can
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enter a ticker symbol and number of shares
    \item Save that information to the local database
    \item View their full list of stocks on the dashboard
    \item See a basic total portfolio value based on placeholder prices
\end{itemize}

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{User Class}
There is one type of user in Snapshot 2.

\textbf{General User}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adds stocks to the portfolio
    \item Views all holdings on the dashboard
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operating Environment}
The system runs in
\begin{itemize}
    \item Any modern browser
    \item A Flask web application environment
    \item A local SQLite database file
    \item A Docker container for deployment if needed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies and Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users must enter valid ticker text since no verification exists in this version
    \item Shares must be a positive number
    \item Flask must be running for the app to work
\end{itemize}

\section{System Features}

\subsection{Feature 1: Add Stock}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User enters ticker and shares
    \item Backend checks that fields are not empty
    \item Stock is saved into SQLite
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature 2: Dashboard Display}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shows every stock stored in the database
    \item Displays ticker, shares, price, and value
    \item Computes a basic total portfolio value
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature 3: Navigation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Navigation bar with access to Home, Dashboard, and Add Stock
\end{itemize}

\section{Error Handling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Missing fields cause a flash message to appear
    \item Shares less than or equal to zero show an error message
    \item Database failures display a fallback error message
\end{itemize}

\section{External Interface Requirements}

\subsection{User Interface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple clean HTML pages rendered by Flask
    \item A dashboard built with a table layout
    \item A form based Add Stock page
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SQLite storage for all holdings
    \item No external price API in Snapshot 2
\end{itemize}

\section{Non Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Usability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interface should stay clear and easy to read
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dashboard loads quickly since no API calls are required
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reliability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data is stored reliably in the SQLite file as long as it is not deleted
\end{itemize}

\section{Out of Scope for Snapshot 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real time price lookup
    \item Stock deletion
    \item Any kind of user login
\end{itemize}

\section{References}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flask documentation
    \item SQLite documentation
\end{itemize}
